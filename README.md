run script etc? just check `package.json`

### personal log (dd/mm/yyyy):

05/02/2025
- implement google auth from 'expo-auth-session' instead of 'react-native-google-signin'

- stuck in "Welcome to Expo" screen solved by put codebase into /src dir.

    - dotenv still not working.

04/02/2025

- run compiled app / `npx expo run:ios` stuck in "Welcome to Expo" screen.

    - tried removing dotenv but shits keep happening.

    - isn't there Expo Go / `npx expo start`, you ask?

        - that ass runner couldn't use library built on custom native code.
